TimeTracker is a small menu bar time tracker for macos.
It was written for me because I am often curious how long my current task is taking.
I didn't find easy solution so here it is.

It has only one option: tracking time.

It looks like this (currently stoped):

It shows hours and minutes.

Timer is active:

Left click for start/pause the timer

Right click to show menu where you can reset the timer or quit the app:

# Installation

Download the latest release as a `.dmg` file, open it and move to your application folder.
Please note that the app is not signed with apple certificates developer,
so you should allow it to run from System Settings -> Security & Privacy -> General tab (for macOS Mojave)
